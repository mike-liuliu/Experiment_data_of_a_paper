2. The first 19 datasets (data 0 to data 18) come from the scikit-learn project, the following 126 datasets come from the two benchmarks of evaluating clustering mentioned in the paper.  
File_names_of_data_19_to_144 lists filenames of the last 126 datasets, readers can check data sources of the datasets by file names from the two benchmarks. If a dataset contains noise data points, the noise was removed from the original dataset.
